# l0lscape
l0lscape (Styilized "**l0lsc4p3**") is an incredibly useless collection of scripts to automate **only** pointless activities in Jagex's MMORPG **RuneScape**.

## Ok but why
Because writing this is fun, but ruining the game is not fun. Collection millions of uncooked rabbits doesn't ruin anyone's experience. Because it's pointless.

## Can't someone just repurpose this codebase to actual game-ruining routines?
If anyone knows enough to repurpose this codebase they know enough to make it themselves anyway.
